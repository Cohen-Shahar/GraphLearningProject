# Graph Learning Project

The project consists of 2 folders, each containing 3 Python notebook files, giving a total of 6 Jupyter Notebook files.

Each notebook corresponds to the final experimental settings, as presented in the project PDF, and showcases results on two datasets: ZINC and MNIST.

## Experiments Overview:
Experiment 1: Uses the architecture from GraphGPS.

Experiment 2: Implements the MLP architecture.

Experiment 3: Features the architecture with cross-attention.


## Folder Structure:
The notebooks are organized based on the dataset:

ZINC Folder: Contains 3 notebooks corresponding to the three experiments.
MNIST Folder: Contains 3 notebooks corresponding to the three experiments.


## Running the Notebooks:
The experiments were conducted using Google Colab (paid version). To reproduce the results:

Open the notebook in Google Colab.
Execute all code cells.
To test different experiments or datasets, modify the dataset loading section and/or adjust the hyperparameters as needed.
